## Project Requirements Document: College Course Planning MVP

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a college course planning platform. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly web application that helps students plan their academic schedules. This platform will be the first version of a larger project with future features to be implemented later.

### 2. User Stories
The following user stories describe the core functionalities from the perspective of a student using the platform.

* **As a new user**, I want to be able to **sign up** with my email and a password so I can create an account.
* **As a returning user**, I want to be able to **log in** to my account so I can access my saved schedule and data.
* **As a student**, I want to be able to **browse and search** for courses by department, course code, or name so I can find classes that interest me.
* **As a student**, I want to be able to **view detailed information** about a course, including a description, prerequisites, and statistics like the average GPA and professor ratings, so I can make an informed decision.
* **As a student**, I want to be able to **add a course** to my personal schedule so I can start building my plan.
* **As a student**, I want to be able to **remove a course** from my schedule so I can easily make changes.

### 3. Functional Requirements
These are the specific functions the platform must perform to meet the user stories.

#### **3.1. User Authentication**
* **FR-1.1:** The system must allow users to create an account with a unique email and password.
* **FR-1.2:** The system must securely store user passwords using a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
* **FR-1.3:** The system must allow registered users to log in with their email and password.
* **FR-1.4:** The system must validate user credentials upon login and provide an appropriate error message for incorrect details.

#### **3.2. Course Directory**
* **FR-2.1:** The system must provide a comprehensive list of all available courses, including their department, course code (e.g., CS 101), and name.
* **FR-2.2:** The system must allow users to search for courses by course code, name, and department.
* **FR-2.3:** The system must display a detailed page for each course, including:
    * **Course Name and Code**
    * **Description**
    * **Prerequisites**
    * **Course Statistics:**
        * Average GPA for the course.
        * Professor names and ratings.
    * **Historical Data:** (Optional but preferred) Data for the last few semesters.

#### **3.3. Schedule Management**
* **FR-3.1:** The system must allow users to add a selected course to their personal schedule.
* **FR-3.2:** The system must display the user's current schedule.
* **FR-3.3:** The system must allow users to remove a course from their schedule.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
These requirements define the quality of the system and its operational environment.

* **NFR-4.1:** The platform must be accessible via a web browser on desktop and mobile devices.
* **NFR-4.2:** The application must have a response time of less than 3 seconds for all major actions (e.g., logging in, searching for a course).
* **NFR-4.3:** All user data, including passwords and schedules, must be securely stored in a database.
* **NFR-4.4:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for college students.

### 5. Technical Stack (Proposed)
The following is a recommended technical stack for development, chosen for its efficiency and scalability.

* **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic user interface.
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django for building the server-side logic.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user and course data.
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication between the frontend and backend.

---

### 6. Development Workflow & Milestones
* **Phase 1: Setup & User Authentication:**
    * Set up the project environment (frontend and backend).
    * Implement user registration and login functionality.
    * Establish secure password hashing and session management.
* **Phase 2: Course Directory:**
    * Create a database schema for course information.
    * Populate the database with a small, sample set of courses and statistics.
    * Develop the course browsing and search functionality.
    * Build the detailed course view page.
* **Phase 3: Schedule Management:**
    * Create a database relationship to link users and courses.
    * Implement "add course to schedule" functionality.
    * Implement "remove course from schedule" functionality.
    * Develop the user's personal schedule view.
* **Phase 4: Finalization & Deployment:**
    * Conduct final testing and bug fixes.
    * Deploy the MVP to a live server.
