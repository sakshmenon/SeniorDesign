## Hey, I'm Saksh ðŸ‘‹ 

### Professional Experience

- Machine Learning Intern â€“ Bioinformatics
    
    *Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Cincinnati, OH*

    â€¢ Designed a user-friendly, efficient tool for biologists to discover and study similarities between two or more organisms; leveraged 2000-4000+ ProtT5 PyTorch embeddings, vector cosine similarities, and four additional search algorithms
    
    â€¢ Reduced similarity search times by 40% compared to industry standards, achieved with an Azure Kubernetes Services workflow; created a new metric to increase confidence in results after preprocessing and transformations on distributed systems
    
    â€¢ Explored several machine learning models, including Protein Language Models, SVC, XGBoost, Ridge, and Lasso to generate predictions on fatal and non-fatal amino acid mutations

- Research Intern â€“ Fault Hunter Software Development 

    *University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH*
    
    â€¢ Pioneered a pattern recognition technique deployed on Linux servers with port forwarding to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of vulnerability detection in embedded systems, specifically by addressing highly skewed data with a label ratio of 50:1
    
    â€¢ Enhanced and tested an application to identify and mitigate over seven vulnerability patterns in both C/C++ and Assembly code, assisted in expanding software capabilities, allowing us to exceed benchmarks
    
    â€¢ Incorporated constructive criticism from 20+/ month code reviews, and mentorship to modify code and experiment with new approaches, improving pre-merge bug detection by 25%

- Student Co-op â€“ Software Development 

    *Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Cincinnati, OH*
    
    â€¢ Extracted insights from over 500,000 readings of fragile X syndrome patient eye tracking data, accomplished with an optimized custom data analysis pipeline, which contributing to the success of multiple research projects for a billion-dollar firm
    
    â€¢ Enhanced productivity by reducing computation times by over 50% with structured, low overhead, and reusable parallel computing techniques in python and MATLAB with a SQL codebase
    
    â€¢ Participated in the development of 3 different projects, aided by open and constructive discussions with cross-functional teams, engaged in brainstorming sessions to collectively arrive at well-informed decisions
