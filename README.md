## 5. ABET Concerns Essay

Our Intelligent Course Planning Platform is influenced by several key constraints that shape 
its design, implementation, and deployment. Economic constraints play a major role, as 
we are developing this project with no dedicated funding and must rely on open-source 
tools, university-provided computing resources, and free-tier cloud services. This limits 
access to premium APIs or commercial-grade hosting, requiring careful optimization to 
ensure scalability and performance without incurring costs. 
Ethical constraints guide how we handle student information, as our system may deal with 
sensitive academic data such as GPA, grades, and course histories. We must ensure that 
all information is stored and processed responsibly, maintaining user consent and 
protecting privacy. Moreover, our recommendation algorithms must be designed to avoid 
bias or unfair academic advice that could negatively affect students’ decisions. 
Security constraints are central to our design. Since the platform potentially stores student 
profiles and academic progress data, strong authentication, encrypted storage, and secure 
communication channels are essential. We must safeguard against unauthorized access, 
data breaches, or manipulation of course planning data. 
Finally, social constraints influence our platform’s purpose and accessibility. Our goal is to 
create a system that benefits all students by promoting equitable academic support and 
peer collaboration. The tool must be inclusive, easy to use, and adaptable to diverse 
academic paths and student backgrounds. By enabling smarter planning and connections 
between students, advisors, and mentors, the project aims to positively impact the 
university learning experience.

## 7. Self-Assessment Essays

### Kshitij Maurya:
Our senior design project is focused on developing an intelligent course planning platform that 
empowers students to map their academic journey semester by semester. From my perspective as 
a Computer Science student, this project represents the intersection of technology, usability, and 
student needs. The platform will incorporate features such as GPA averages, professor options, 
and customized pathways, while also including collaborative and social functions that connect 
students with peers, study groups, and mentoring opportunities. By approaching the problem 
from a technical and student-centered lens, my goal is to contribute to creating a tool that 
simplifies academic planning while enhancing the overall university experience. 
My academic coursework has prepared me to take on this challenge. Courses such as CS 2028 – 
Data Structures and CS 4071 – Software Engineering provided me with the ability to design 
efficient algorithms and develop scalable, maintainable applications, both of which are essential 
for building a platform that must handle complex scheduling logic. CS 3059 – Computer 
Networks introduced me to networking principles, which will help in enabling collaborative and 
social features on the platform. Meanwhile, courses like CS 3033 – Database Design and CS 
3034 – Web Development directly inform the project’s need for structured data storage and an 
intuitive interface. These classes taught me how to design schemas, manage relationships 
between data entities, and create engaging user experiences with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 
Together, my academic experiences have provided the technical depth and problem-solving 
mindset to contribute meaningfully to the project. 
In addition to coursework, my co-op experiences gave me valuable real-world insights that will 
guide the project’s development. At Cenovus Energy, as a Process Control Co-Op, I learned to 
script automated tasks in PowerShell and maintain critical system integrity, skills that sharpened 
my ability to design reliable, error-resistant processes. At Almoayed International Group, as a 
Network Administration Co-Op, I developed a strong foundation in diagnosing network issues 
and documenting infrastructure, reinforcing the importance of communication, accuracy, and 
collaboration. My time at Aluminum Bahrain (ALBA) as an IT Department Intern introduced 
me to enterprise-scale systems such as SAP ERP, exposing me to large-scale data processing and 
the challenges of integrating complex systems. These experiences taught me not only technical 
skills in automation, system monitoring, and web development but also professional skills such 
as teamwork, attention to detail, and adaptability—all of which are critical to successfully 
designing a project that others will depend on. 
I am highly motivated to participate in this project because I see the potential for it to positively 
impact students’ lives. During my academic journey, I often found myself manually juggling 
degree requirements, professor availability, and workload balance. This personal challenge 
makes me passionate about developing a smarter solution that saves time and reduces stress for 
future students. Moreover, the idea of combining academic planning with social and 
collaborative features excites me because it aligns with the growing importance of peer-to-peer 
support in higher education. The project is not only technically interesting but also socially 
impactful, making it a meaningful capstone experience. 
Our preliminary approach to the project will be to start with requirements gathering, focusing on 
core features such as degree tracking, course scheduling, and GPA prediction. From there, we 
will design the system architecture with modular components: a back-end database for storing 
course and student data, an algorithmic engine for scheduling and GPA insights, and a front-end 
interface for user interaction. Expected results include a working prototype that allows students 
to map out a four-year plan while receiving real-time feedback on academic progress. To self
evaluate my contributions, I will establish milestones such as delivering a functional scheduling 
module, ensuring database efficiency, and testing usability with real students. I will consider my 
work successful when the tool demonstrates reliability, accuracy, and ease of use, and when I can 
see that my contributions have directly improved the platform’s value to its users.

### Saksh Menon:
As a current senior, I have spent a lot of time using university resources to plan out my
academics and co-ops. I have my fair share of opinions on the resources available and I
would like to build something that makes the planning experience easier. The goal of
our senior design project is to make the course registration process for students at UC
easier. Students will be able to build a social network around their courses, allowing
them to plan build their entire schedules with peers with access to all forms of course
information like GPA stats, professor reviews, and course reviews.
I am currently a senior with the university set to graduate in the upcoming spring. I
participated in multiple courses that help build the foundations of my knowledge in CS.
Data Structures and Algorithms, Deep Learning, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and
Programming for C were examples of courses that helped shape my background in CS.
These courses gave me an understanding of fundamental concepts and their direct
applications in a multitude of examples. I look forward to using the knowledge gained
from these courses to build a solution to the situation described above.
I have completed 3 co-ops and am scheduled for a co-op next semester. I have held
software engineering and machine learning positions with Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
I also held a software engineering position at a research capacity under the supervision
of a professor. I learned how to adapt solutions to better fit complex problems and how
to articulate my proposed solutions to a given problem. I look forward to making use of
this to better explain my solution to people that are directly affected by this application.
My experience with the planning resources was not the greatest. I had a lot of edge
case questions that I could not have answered with ease. Advisor appointments were
difficult to schedule during peak academic registrations. This was a major cause of
uncertainty for my academic planning. When this idea was conceived, I was excited to
know how many students can benefit from the clarity of academic planning regardless
of time constraints.
Our initial approach consists of a platform where students can openly plan out their
entire academic journey with a hands-on approach making it easier to understand. We
expect to migrate the entire student body onto this platform. We expect to know that we
have accomplished our goal when we have an active user base with active feedback on
how to make our systems better. We want our platform to make college planning
significantly easier and less intimidating.
