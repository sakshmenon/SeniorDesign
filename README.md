#### Project Abstract:
Introducing Gradly. Restructuring the way students plan their academic journey and so much more.

<br>

## 2. Project Description 

#### Team Name: Gradly

#### Project Topic Area:
- This platform is an intelligent course planning tool designed to help university students map out their entire academic journey. It combines semester-by-semester scheduling with insights such as GPA averages, professor options, and personalized pathways, making it easier to stay on track toward graduation. With collaborative and social features, it not only simplifies planning but also connects students with peers, study groups, and mentoring opportunities.

## 3. User Stories And Design Diagmrams

> User stories are written from the end-user perspective and express the goal and benefit.

1. **As an undergraduate student**, I want to generate a semester‑by‑semester plan that satisfies degree requirements and prerequisites **so that** I can stay on track for on‑time graduation without manual spreadsheets.
2. **As a transfer student**, I want to import my completed credits and map them to my target major’s curriculum **so that** I can see exactly what remains and choose the fastest, feasible pathway.
3. **As a student choosing courses**, I want to compare sections by professor, historical GPA averages, time slots, and workload indicators **so that** I can balance difficulty across semesters and improve my academic outcomes.
4. **As a student seeking support**, I want to discover recommended peer study groups and mentors aligned to my current courses **so that** I can collaborate effectively and improve learning.
5. **As an academic advisor**, I want to review, comment on, and approve a student’s proposed plan **so that** I can ensure degree compliance while tailoring guidance to the student’s goals.

_Notes_: Each story will be refined into acceptance criteria and test cases in later assignments.
